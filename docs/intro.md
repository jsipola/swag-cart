## Concept
The main concept of the project is to create mounting for a a small display and mechanism so that the display can be moved in vertical direction.
The display will be mounted to a small cart. The display will be connected to a raspberry pi 3 and a power source.
Several options for the mechanism which moves the display was considered but after careful consideration a system which is easy to implement was chosen, a servo motor which rotates a bar with a ball screw which in turn is attached to the display.
The rotation of the motor is transformed into linear movement for the display. A similar system is found in 3d printers to control the position of the extruder.
A system which involves several gear wheels was also considered but was deemed too complex.
